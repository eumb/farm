"main_text":"Traditional agriculture companies have applied for ages the same tools and processes that have become antiquated these days. Most of the organizations that work on the farming sector have realized the great potential that cutting edge technologies have to ease their 
daily works, reduce losses or improve the yield quantity and also product quality.Wireless sensor networks have opened a wide range in terms of possibilities for farmers and agricultural management organizations. Getting real-time information from different water, soil or air parameters of any field allows taking smart and strategic decisions to save resources and optimize yields.",
"second_text":"
We  developed a  smart system to monitor soil, water quality, water storage and environmental parameters installing several Waspmote Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture.  
Mounted in a field provides information about soil temperature, soil moisture, air temperature, humidity and preassure. 
Waspmote Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture are installed outdoors. One, with the anemometer + wind vane + pluviometer sensor, monitors wind speed, gusts, direction and amount of rain. Another, monitors soil temperature and soil moisture.",
